Nathan's Pokemon TCG DB:
Day 1:
 Created new react-app via Ubuntu, added components for axios and react-router-dom, removed .git folder
 Created Repsository on Github, ran commands for the first commit, but got stuck as Github does not allow commits using account password, now requires a special passkey or alternative method of commits. Attempted upload to Github via drag and drop of files, however figured out the passkey solution and was able to commit to repo through Ubuntu.
 Began initial setup of app utilising code and lessons from the GA JSD coursework and homework projects (particularly flickr-app-react and movie-database-react)
 Now have base functionality of the Homepage, SearchResults page, and Card Details page (essentially the bones of the projects minimum requirements).
 Next steps are to add functionality for other pages and styling for the project - (Styling has been a weakness of mine throughout the GA JSD course so I knew a lot of my time on the project would relate to styling)



 Issues so far:
  Adding the react-app into Github - solved by troubleshooting and finding the passkey option
  How to make a react-app show correctly when hosted by Github - solved by troubleshooting on Google - found multiple guides detailing the process of installing a gitpages npm command and changing attributes in the package.json file ("Homepage", "Pre-deploy", and "Deploy")
  Some cards in the API do not have an "image" link in the objects, so when these cards are displayed in SearchResults or the Card Page (detailspage) then the broken image shows the default browser snippet. This to be researched as the method for displaying img src in this app is different to the flickr or moviedb apps which I had found solutions for in the course/homework.

Code learned externally:
 npm gitpages installer for the document & package.json attributes to configure - multiple guides online through a google search

Lessons so far in final project:
 In the 2 lessons learning react, it felt like I was not understanding the processes that Luke was teaching, although some components were making sense, I was largely of the belief that my final project would be completed using base JS and that react would be for further learning post-course. This all seemed to change in the week8 homework converting the moviedb app into a react project. I started to click with a lot of the interactions of the system and the idea that I could use a similar format for the final project started. There are still many parts of it all that I am unsure of but each day spent on these projects something new becomes a lot clearer!
