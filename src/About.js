                 Nathan Flanders, age 36. Completing General Assembly's Javascript Development Course via the Digital Jobs Program Victoria. Prior to this course, I had near-zero coding experience, only some basic HTML and CSS in high school! In preparation for the course, I did an online bootcamp course for HTML and CSS, and touched very lightly into JS.

                <p>
                    This page was made for the final project of the JSD course, where students were asked to build a single-page-app that runs off a public API to produce a 'search results' page and a 'details page'. I selected the Pokemon TCG Database API due to a childhood love for the franchise, I was in grade 5 when the series first reached Australia, and was forever captivated by the juggernaut series.
